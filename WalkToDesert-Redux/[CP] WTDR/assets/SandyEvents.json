Said the bus was never around when he needed it!$h#$b#So he made a bus out of pure magic -- it could cross the boundary any time he wanted. Not a bad idea, huh?#$b#But the locals weren't ready for that much magic. The Oasis is still cursed, you know? They didn't want to risk getting trapped in here.#$b#So after the real bus broke down, nobody's come to the Oasis. Except for the few people with warp totems...$s\"/emote Sandy 16/speak Sandy \"Sorry for rambling a bit.$0#$b#I'm glad you're brave enough to make the trip!$h\"/emote farmer 32/end",
